React Routing 
************* 

What we are going to do today
*****************************

	Create the iphones page using data in a json file 
		- Generate the pages from a json file 
		- Do not include the detail description on the landing page 
		- Link each of them to their individual product page 

	Create Dynamic Individual page 
		- Automatically render the individual product page based on the url 
		- Include the description 


Key concepts to cover 
********************* 
first import The react-router-dom library on app.js
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
	

	BrowserRouter
		To add the ability to add routing functionality 

	Switch
		Checks provided paths and stops checking all as soon as it finds a match 

	Route
		Renders components based on the URL


        additional

	Link 
		Used to create links. But it has an extra advantage of passing props to 

	Dynamic Routing 
		Create a page for each product dynamically 


        example
        first import all components included
                    Router
                        Switch  
                            Route{path & component(use exact or without exact)
                                                    prepare four04 page for not existing pages }

                        function App() {
                return (
                    <Router>
                    <div>
                        <Navigation />
                        <Switch>
                        <Route path="/" exact component={Main} />
                        <Route path="/mac" exact component={Mac} />
                        <Route path="/iphone" exact component={Iphone} />
                        <Route path="/iphone/:pid" exact component={Productpage} />
                        <Route path="/" component={Four04} />
                        </Switch>
                        <Footer />
                    </div>
                    </Router>
                );
                }

What to focus on next
********************* 
	- How can we replace the json local file we used to store products with a database? 

	- How can we add more products?

	- How can we use Node to achieve that

React Bootstrap

	Reference site 
		https://react-bootstrap.github.io/

	Installing bootstrap on your react app 
		npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap --save 

	How to include the bootstrap css on your app 
		Import the css on your index.js or app.js file 
		
		import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'; 



	To use a bootstrap component on your react app, import the component you want to use 
		Eg: If you want to use the bootstrap button on your react app, import the button component form the react-bootstrap module first 

			import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

			Usage example: 
				<Button variant="primary">Primary</Button> 

			- You can find examples of all available bootstrap components in here 
				https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts 

	Creating the Apple navbar using the React-bootstrap module 
		We can use the Navbar component for that 
		https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navbar/ 

		Eg: Implement the navbar on apple's website 


steps to do navigations with router

1.import 
		import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
		import React, { Component, useEffect, useState } from "react";
2.import pages and components you want to route

3.start the database server or import the json file

4.create and manage fetch component
		example
		const[products, setproducts]=useState([]);
		useEffect(()=>{
			fetch(".iphones.json")
			.then((res)=>res.json())
			.then((data)=>{
			const productspro=data;
			setproducts(productspro)
			})
		},[])
		console.log(products)

5.install react-router-dom
	 	npm i react-router-dom@5
5. return

		        // new api method on router v5
        <Router>
          <div>
            {/* enter all components that remainns all over the changes */}
            <Switch>
              {/* // enter the url path and component name */}
              <Route  path="" exact component={} />

              {/* enter the default page for url error path will be "/"  */}
              <Route path="" component={Four04}/>

            </Switch>
          </div>

        </Router>


additional 
install npm react-bootstrap
